### Hi! 👋

I'm Alex, a fifth-year Computer Science Honours student at the University of Manitoba. On the side I enjoy gardening, cooking, playing video games, staying up way too late working on a side project, and catching up on sleep, usually in that order.

#### Recent and ongoing projects:

🦖 An input buffer for the Godot game engine, which makes user input more responsive and comes with a scary-accurate replica of the Google Chrome dino game to test it with

⌚ Instaweather, a lightning-fast weather app for the totally-retro Pebble smartwatch
