### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Computer Science Honours student at the University of Manitoba. On the side I enjoy gardening, cooking, playing video games, staying up way too late working on a side project, and catching up on sleep, usually in that order.

#### Stuff I have in the works:

âŒš Instant Weather, a lightning-fast weather app for the totally-retro-at-this-point Pebble smartwatch

ðŸ”® An untitled game - currently prototyping and experimenting with different engines, genres, and mechanics for a new game to follow up on Crazy Tennis, a project I finished earlier this year. Coming "soon"!
